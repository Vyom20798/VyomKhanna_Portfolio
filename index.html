  <div class="dropdown" style="position: relative;">
      <button class="dropdown-btn">Predicting London Bike Usage Using Machine Learning</button>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
          <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>The report aims to address operational challenges in London's bike-sharing scheme by analyzing and forecasting bike usage patterns. Specifically, it seeks to:</p>
          <ol class="hanging-indent">
              <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analytics</strong>: Analyse urban mobility and cycling preferences among London's diverse population.</li>
              <li><strong>Machine Learning Model</strong>: Develop predictive models to forecast bike usage, utilising weather and bike trip data to optimise bike availability and distribution, thus enhancing user satisfaction and operational efficiency.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The overarching goal is to support the data-driven management of London's bike-sharing scheme by understanding user behavior patterns and accurately predicting demand to improve service allocation.</p>
          
          <h3>Methodology</h3>
          <ol>
              <li><strong>Data Collection and Processing</strong>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Urban Mobility Patterns: Data from Transport for London (TfL), detailing trip start/end times, duration, and station locations for June 2023.</li>
                      <li>Predictive Modeling: Weather data (July to September 2023) from Visual Crossing, incorporating temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              
              <li><strong>Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering</strong>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Data Cleaning: Removed outliers and filtered irrelevant entries (e.g., trips under a minute or over a day).</li>
                      <li>Feature Engineering: Added columns for day of the week, time of day, routes, trip durations, and weather conditions.</li>
                      <li>Normalisation: Used MinMaxScaler to normalise features and enhance model performance.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              
              <li><strong>Machine Learning Models</strong>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Tested algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks, SVM, and XGBoost.</li>
                      <li>Evaluation metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-Squared (R²), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).</li>
                      <li>Results: Linear Regression showed the best accuracy for temperature-bicycle usage prediction, followed by Decision Trees and Random Forest.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <ol>
              <li><strong>Urban Mobility Insights</strong>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Peak usage was in the afternoon, with the highest rental day on June 21, 2023.</li>
                      <li>Hyde Park Corner was the most popular station, indicating a preference for central London routes.</li>
                      <li>Highest rentals occurred on weekday afternoons, particularly Thursdays and Fridays, suggesting an after-work trend.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              
              <li><strong>Predictive Model Findings</strong>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Linear Regression had the highest accuracy, showing temperature as a key predictor of bike rentals.</li>
                      <li>Future improvements: Adding more non-linear models (e.g., SVM with non-linear kernels) and more features (humidity, day of the week) to capture additional factors affecting demand.</li>
                      <li>Recommendations: Adjust bike distribution based on weather forecasts, stocking more bikes in high-demand areas on warm days.</li>
                  </ul>

    <p>I've heard the feedback—yes, I’m currently in Southampton. But here’s the deal: I’m here temporarily, just until I land a job. Having relocated from India to the UK, I'm more than ready to move again for the right opportunity.

      I didn’t realise location might raise eyebrows in the job search, but no worries! I’m happy to relocate without any relocation package. Manchester, Bristol, London? I’m there. For other areas, just give me a week to pack my bags!</p>

    <p>Ah, the classic ‘Right to Work’ question! Currently, I'm on a student visa and have successfully completed my degree with a solid 65% score, just waiting for the official results. Once those come in, I'll be applying for my Graduate Visa, granting me full work rights in The United Kingdom until January 2027. After that, I’ll be on the lookout for sponsorship to continue contributing my skills.

        Given my dedication, skills, and work ethic, I’m confident that any forward-thinking company will be happy to support my journey and maybe even sponsor my visa. Challenge accepted!</p>
