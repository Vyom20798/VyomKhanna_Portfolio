                    for the Managing Director and Heads of Departments (Claims, Finance, Sales, and Actuarial). The

                    verticals, supporting agile decision-making and deeper accountability.

                </ol>
                <p>All reports were designed with data integrity, KPI alignment, and executive usability in mind. All
                    data sources were linked using Policy Number + Policy Start Date as a composite identifier across
                    modules.

                    I’m here temporarily,
                    just until I land a job. Having relocated from India to the UK, I'm more than ready to move again
                    for the right opportunity.

                    I didn’t realise location might raise eyebrows in the job search, but no worries! I’m happy to
                    relocate without any relocation package. Manchester, Bristol, London? I’m there. For other areas,
                    just give me a week to pack my bags!</p>

                    Ah, the classic ‘Right to Work’ question! I am currently on a Graduate Visa,
                    valid until 23rd January 2027.
                    After that, I would be needing sponsorship to continue contributing my skills and expertise.
                    With my dedication, strong work ethic, and commitment to excellence, I am confident that any
                    organisation will recognise my value and support my journey,
                    including potential visa sponsorship. Challenge accepted!

                    After browsing through this page, you may have some reservations perhaps about my visa status,
                    UK-based
                    experience, or industry alignment. Let me assure you that my strong work ethic, adaptability, and
                    eagerness to learn will bridge any perceived gaps.
                    If you’re willing to take a leap of faith, I will prioritise proving that it was the right choice.

                    projects that have honed my ability to excel in any industry. I am confident that with just a couple
                    of
                    months of immersion, I can seamlessly adapt to a new work environment, office routines, compliance
                    requirements, and team dynamics. My background in healthcare insurance has given me valuable
                    insights
                    into the importance of accuracy, process integrity, and maintaining high standards qualities I carry

                <p class="justified-text">
                    I have also taken the initiative to familiarise myself with UK GDPR / Data Protection Act 2018 rules
                    and
                    regulations, and my
                    experience in healthcare has instilled in me a deep understanding of the critical importance of data
                    integrity and confidentiality. While I’m eager to explore opportunities across various sectors, I’m
                    confident that my skills and commitment to excellence will add significant value to any team.
                    If given the opportunity, I’ll bring fresh perspectives, a strong drive to contribute, and the
                    ability
                    to quickly adapt to the organisation’s culture and goals. I would be delighted to discuss how I can
