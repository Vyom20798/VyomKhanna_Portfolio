                <p>The report aims to address operational challenges in London's bike-sharing scheme by analysing and
                    forecasting bike usage patterns. Specifically, it seeks to:</p>
                <ol class="hanging-indent">
                    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analytics:</strong>Analyse urban mobility and cycling preferences among
                        London's diverse population.</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning Model:</strong>Develop predictive models to forecast bike usage,
                        utilising
                        weather and bike trip data to optimise bike availability and distribution, thus enhancing user

                                rentals.</li>
                            <li>Future improvements: Adding more non-linear models (e.g., SVM with non-linear kernels)
                                and
                                more features (humidity, day of the week) to capture additional factors affecting

                            </li>
                            <li>Recommendations: Adjust bike distribution based on weather forecasts, stocking more

                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>The report aims to solve a series of SQL-based data analytics tasks within a
                    healthcare context, focusing on various aspects of staff management and operations.
                    Key objectives include:</p>
                <ol class="hanging-indent">
                    <li><strong>Calculating Work Hours and Staff Allocation:</strong>Determine the
                        number of hours worked by specific staff members and calculate staffing
                        requirements across departments and shifts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identifying Employee Details:</strong>Use SQL queries to retrieve
                        detailed information about staff, such as birthdates and assigned departments.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Analysing Staff Distribution by Specialty:</strong>Examine staffing

                        implications of staffing across various hospital specialties within a defined
                        timeframe.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Overall, the objective is to apply SQL data manipulation techniques to extract
                    actionable insights from hospital data for resource optimisation, staffing analysis,
                    and cost management.</p>

                <p>The report's primary objective is to examine strategic decisions essential for
                    transitioning from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric
                    vehicles
                    (EVs) within the automotive sector, particularly in Southampton. The objectives
                    include:</p>
                <ol class="hanging-indent">

                        and
                        multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques to evaluate optimal
                        locations
                        for EV infrastructure and to guide policy and business strategy decisions

            <h2 class="section-title">Mobility</h2>
            <p>I've heard the feedback—yes, I’m currently in Southampton. But here’s the deal: I’m here temporarily,
                just until I land a job. Having relocated from India to the UK, I'm more than ready to move again
                for the right opportunity.

                I didn’t realise location might raise eyebrows in the job search, but no worries! I’m happy to
                relocate without any relocation package. Manchester, Bristol, London? I’m there. For other areas,
                just give me a week to pack my bags!</p>

        <section id="right_to_work">
            <h2 class="section-title">Right to Work</h2>
            <p>Ah, the classic ‘Right to Work’ question! Currently, I'm on a student visa and have successfully
                completed my degree with a solid 65% score, just waiting for the official results. Once those come
                in, I'll be applying for my Graduate Visa, granting me full work rights in The United Kingdom until
                January 2027. After that, I’ll be on the lookout for sponsorship to continue contributing my skills.

                Given my dedication, skills, and work ethic, I’m confident that any forward-thinking company will be
                happy to support my journey and maybe even sponsor my visa. Challenge accepted!</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Lastly...</h2>
            <p>After browsing through this page, you may have some reservations—perhaps about my visa status,
                UK-based experience, or industry alignment. Let me assure you that my strong work ethic,
                adaptability, and eagerness to learn will bridge any gaps. If you’re willing to take a leap of
                faith, I’ll make it my priority to prove that it was the right choice.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Being in the early stages of my career, I have the flexibility to blend seamlessly into the UK work
                culture, bringing fresh perspectives while quickly adapting to new environments. Though my
                experience is rooted in healthcare insurance, I’m enthusiastic and open to contributing to any
                sector that offers an exciting opportunity.
                I’d be more than happy to discuss how my skills can add value to your team.</p>
